üåê Deployment
This project is deployed using a decoupled architecture for optimal performance and scalability.

Frontend: The React application is hosted on Vercel, providing a fast global CDN for static assets.

Backend: The Node.js API is hosted as a Web Service on Render, which automatically sleeps on inactivity to stay within the free tier.

Database: MongoDB Atlas serves as the cloud database, accessible from the hosted backend.

This setup ensures a professional, scalable, and cost-effective hosting solution.
